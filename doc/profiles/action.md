# Action Profile

```
Profile: <https://level3.rest/profiles/action>
```

An Action resource is a hypermedia control that triggers a state change. They act like buttons to execute an action on the server. Actions do not accept a payload; the URL contains all the Actionâ€™s identifying information.

### Discovery

The Action profile presents the required `Profile` and `Allow` headers.

### Trigger Action

Clients trigger an Action by `POST`ing to it. The resource responds with `303 See Other` and the `Location` header points to the state that was changed by the triggered action. The resource returns a `403 Forbidden` status if the action cannot be completed because the business state will not accept it.

# Mixins

## Representation Mixin

The [Representation profile](representation.md) mixin enables the client to receive the target representation in the Action response instead of a redirect to the `Location` URL.
