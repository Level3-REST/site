# Action Profile

##### `Profile: <http://level3.rest/profiles/action>`

An Action resource is a hypermedia control that triggers a state change. They act like buttons to execute an action on the server. Actions do not accept a payload; the URL contains all the Actionâ€™s identifying information.

### Discovery

The Action profile presents the required `Profile` and `Allow` headers.

### Trigger Action

Clients trigger an Action by `POST`ing to it. The resource responds with `204 No Content` and the `Location` header points to the state that was changed by the triggered action.
