# Mixin Profiles

Mixin profiles add behaviour and capabilities to other profiles. A resource offers additional capabilities to clients by adding additional `Profile` headers indicating the presence of a mixin. A client uses mixin profiles to interpret the responses from a resource as well as create requests that utilize the mixin's capabilities.
Level 3 profiles specify their possible mixins in a Mixin section. This section teaches a client how to interact with the profileâ€™s mixins in the context of the resource.
