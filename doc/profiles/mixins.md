# Mixin Profiles

Mixin profiles add behavior and capabilities to other profiles. A Client can use mixin profiles to alter the responses from a resource in different ways. The available mixin profiles are discovered in the `Profile` header list. Level 3 profiles have specified their possible mixins so a client will know how to interact with the profileâ€™s mixins successfully in the context of the resource they are working with.
