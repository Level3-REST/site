# Home Profile

##### `Profile: <http://level3.rest/profiles/home>`

The Home resource is the top resource for a graph of related resources. Homes cannot be deleted or edited in any way. A Home resource typically has no ID data in itâ€™s URI, which is a stable location for clients to access directly.

### Discovery

The Home profile presents the required `Profile` and `Allow` headers.
